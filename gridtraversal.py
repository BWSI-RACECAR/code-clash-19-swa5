Code Clash #19 - Grid Traversal (gridtraversal.py)


Author: Wonjun Lee

Difficulty Level: 8/10

Prompt: Bill’s RACECAR is designed so that it can move either DOWN or RIGHT in a given m x n grid. 
The RACECAR begins at the top-left corner (grid[0][0]) and is trying to reach the bottom-right corner 
(grid[m-1][n-1]). Please write a function that returns the number of unique paths that Bill’s 
RACECAR can take to reach its destination.

Constraints: 1 <= m,n <= 100 ; the output will be less than 2 * 10^9

Test Cases:
Input: m=2; n=2; Output = 2
Input: m=3; n=2; Output = 3
Input: m=3; n=7; Output = 28
